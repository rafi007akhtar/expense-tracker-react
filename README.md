# Expense Tracker

This app was created as a part of the the course [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy.

It's a modest expense tracker that is built using some of the most basic React concepts, like:
- components
- props
- state
- lifting of state
- conditional rendering
- dynamic rendering
- event handling

and so on.

It covers the first 5 sections of the course.
